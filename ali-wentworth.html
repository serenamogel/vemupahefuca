Source: Instagram</p><p>The prominent American actress took to Instagram to announce that she was struggling with COVID-19 while self-quarantining in their New York home. She shared the unfortunate news on 1 April 2020. Then on 13 April 2020, her husband, Georg, also announced that, though he was asymptomatic, he too tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The couple joined the ABC late-night show on April 15 and shared their journey and experience with the novel coronavirus that is creating a global pandemic around the world in 2020. George Stephanopoulos only suffered some lower-back pain and a brief loss of smell several weeks prior to the test.</p><p>However, Ali’s case was more severe. She spent 16 days bedridden after she contracted the virus and she battled the symptoms including a high fever and body aches during this time. Talking about their experience, her husband says:</p><p>“Ali had a real tough case. She was in bed for a couple of weeks. I’ve never had a fever, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath, never had chills. The only thing I could think of is, one day, a couple, now almost three weeks ago, there was a little bit of lower back pain and went to bed early. And then a couple of days after that had no sense of smell for about a day. But that was several weeks ago. And since then, just nothing beyond that.”</p><p>Then Ali Wentworth jokingly shares the varying experience the lovers had individually during the show:</p><p>“It’s funny because it’s very indicative of our lives. I get corona and I’m deathly ill for three weeks with a high fever and sweating and achy and going crazy like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. And George gets it, and he has no symptoms. The whole thing annoys me and if I wasn’t quarantined with him, we would probably take a separate weekend away.”</p><h4><span>More details</span></h4><p>Ali also shared that her husband was actually a rock star during this time and helped her recover. Though George didn’t have to bathe her or anything, he frequently brought her food. When asked how she handled her isolation, Ali said she spent most of the time focused on getting healthy and getting well. She mostly slept and took Tylenol P.M. timely. She further adds:</p><p>“I watched all seven seasons of Mad Men. And in my delirium, I actually believe, I thought I was married to Jon Hamm and that he was cheating on me.”</p><p>As Ali was on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she told the viewers that if they had coronavirus and had any questions about the experience, they could come directly to her. She said,&nbsp;“I’m telling you right now, you can DM me on Instagram if you have it and you’re scared and you want any pointers”. Ali also added that talking to people who had COVID-19 was really helpful when she was first diagnosed.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_Childhood>Early life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Ali Wentworth was born on <strong>12 January 1965</strong> and she is currently <strong>56 years old</strong>.
