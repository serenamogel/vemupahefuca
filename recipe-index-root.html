Move over, soggy lettuce and watery tomatoes—this shaved fennel salad is crisp, refreshing, and bright, just the thing to balance a hearty pasta or other comforting meal. Fresh fennel is one of the most underrated vegetables…and it also happens to be one of my favorites. It has a really lovely anise flavor and, when it’s raw, a great crunchy texture.
