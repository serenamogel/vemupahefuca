to several published articles, the television personality made over $70 million in 2012.</p><p>Dick Wolf baggs between $10 and $15 million per month from his television empire, according to a court declaration filed in January 2019 as part of his divorce from Noelle Lippman.</p><p>That’s between $120 and $180 million a year.</p><p>According to the same filing, Wolf and Lippman had a signed contract that protects a major chunk of their TV assets, while she would still be entitled to half of his salary and half of the assets they acquired during their marriage, which lasted from 2006 to 2018.</p><p>Wolf and Marburg’s divorce began in the early 2000s and was officially finalized in 2005.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the value of “<strong>Law & Order</strong>” was a major topic of discussion throughout their settlement talks.</p><p>Marburg was legally entitled to half of the show’s value because it was made after their marriage. Financial experts believed that “Law & Order’s” overall value then was only $8 million during talks.</p><p>One can guess what a shock Marburg might have gotten when she read the LA Times a few months after signing the settlement agreement that Wolf was completing a new production deal with NBC worth $1.6 billion.</p><h2>Net Worth of Richard Anthony Wolf&nbsp; in Different Currencies</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s look into </span>Richard Anthony Wolf’s <span style=font-weight:400>net worth in different currencies, including the cryptocurrency BitCoin.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Currency</b></td><td><b>Net Worth</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Euro</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>€&nbsp; <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":466283454.99999994}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>466,283,455</span></span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Pound Sterling</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>£&nbsp; <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":399564165}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>399,564,165</span></span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Australian Dollar</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>A$&nbsp; <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":752188250}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>752,188,250</span></span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Canadian Dollar</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>C$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":694311749.9999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>694,311,750</span></span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Indian Rupee</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>₹&nbsp; <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":40423240000.00001}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>40,423,240,000</span></span></td></tr><tr><td><b>BitCoin</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>฿ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":11229.8945}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>11,230</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You might be interested to know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Dave Ramsey</a> too.</p><h2>Richard Anthony Wolf Houses, and Cars</h2><h3>Houses</h3><h4>Maine House</h4><p>Wolf bought a $10.5 million property on Maine’s Mount Desert Island in 2003.</p><p>Seal Harbor has only a few structures, and Wolf is one of the island’s seasonal occupants.
