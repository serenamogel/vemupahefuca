She wrote:</p><p>I am alive and well. Thank you for your love and support. God bless you all.</p><p>She also posted a video on Instagram, where she sang a snippet of her song “Landslide” and said:</p><p>I just want to say thank you for all of your love and support. I’m doing fine. I’m here at home, and I’m just enjoying life. And I want you to do the same. God bless you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Current Projects and Plans of Moore</h2><p>Moore, who is best known for her roles in Indecent Proposal, Ghost, and A Few Good Men, is one of the most acclaimed and influential actresses of all time.
