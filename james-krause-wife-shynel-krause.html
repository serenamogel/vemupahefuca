Throughout the years, the husband and wife have kept their love while excelling in their separate fields.</p><p>They initially met paths about a decade ago, and they were both involved in MMA to some extent at the time. Shynel was an Olympic power lifter who also competed in Crossfit, while James worked full-time as an MMA and UFC fighter.</p><p>She formerly worked as a fitness trainer and is now pursuing two careers concurrently. She is currently employed as an instructor at Glory MMA And Fitness, where she specialises in MMA instruction and fighting practise for those who are interested.</p><p>Because of her fitness journey, she has acquired a passion for educating and motivating other women. In her classes, she stresses overcoming any physical or mental restrictions. Shynel also provides technical and secure strength training coaching. Her objective is to inspire women to be self-assured, psychologically and physically powerful.</p><p>She is a powerful nurse who operates her health care services on Instagram while working as a fitness instructor. Her company, The DRIPBaR, is dedicated to its clients’ health and well-being and provides innovative, safe treatments backed up by the most recent data and research. Its goal is to enhance physical, mental, and cellular wellness by encouraging people to go beyond food, exercise, and traditional medicine for their healthcare.</p><h2 id=does-james-krause-have-children><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_James_Krause_Have_Children></span>Does James Krause Have Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Krause is a family man who has two wonderful children with his wife, Shynel Krause, a boy named Beckaett and a girl named Lincon.</p><p>The UFC instructor adores his children, and the youngsters enjoy their father’s company. Lincoln, his oldest daughter, is a cute little girl who aspires to perform sports like her father did when she was her age.</p><p>He doesn’t get enough time with his kids, but when he does, the UFC instructor makes sure they have a good time with their father.</p><p>He hasn’t said anything about his other child. He is still a toddler, and as evidenced by several Instagram images, he enjoys being with his parents and running around.</p><p>The Krauses have provided their children with adequate facilities so that they can grow up in a sophisticated environment and focus on becoming great sports stars like their father.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Facts_About_James_Krause%E2%80%99s_Family></span>Facts About James Krause’s Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James had a difficult childhood because his parents, who are considered the most important people in a child’s life when growing up, divorced when he was two.</p><p>He was transferred to live with his mother, who was in dire need at the time. His father’s family, on the other hand, had a far better financial situation. When James was a child, he experienced the disadvantages of having an unpredictable economic condition vs reaching your financial ambitions.</p><p>Fighting was just something he did to distract himself from his problems. As a result, he began karate instruction at the age of seven. He wrestled while attending Odessa High School in Missouri. He later enrolled in college but dropped out to focus on mixed martial arts.</p><p>Because of this contrast, James has continued to work for his goals throughout his time in the UFC and as a fight producer and gym owner. He knew what he wanted to achieve from a young age, so he began polishing his skills and became one of his generation’s most skilled and feared MMA and UFC fighters.</p><p>When his name is proclaimed at a combat sports event, he is described as a composed and serene fighter who could battle in such a way that his opponents would be shocked and favour him with victory.</p><p>He didn’t have much support from his family when he was younger, but he’s stronger now that he has his children and wife rooting for him. For the past 11 years, he has been married to his lovely wife, Shynel. They dated for three years before getting married. They began dating in 2008 and have been together for 12 years. The union occurred on May 29, 2011.</p><p>Their lives were going well, with no major problems, until one of the female combatants made various charges about his illicit involvement with another lady on social media. He has not commented on the matter as of yet, but it is expected that he will issue a remark on the subject soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_James_Krause%E2%80%99s_Age></span>What Is James Krause’s Age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 4, 1986, James Krause was born.

He was sent to live with his impoverished mother at the time. His father’s family, on the other hand, was far more financially secure. As a child, James experienced the difficulties of being financially unstable vs achieving one’s financial ambitions. This contrast helped imprint in James a vision of his aspirations, which he continues to work toward today through his UFC career, fight promotion, and club ownership.</p><p>James and his wife have two girls of their own, and they have also acted as surrogate parents for his adolescent sister Lilly. James’ mother was engaged in a DUI vehicle accident and drug paraphernalia was discovered in her car. She was sentenced to four years in prison, and rather than have his sister become a ward of the state, James and his wife took her in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/James-Krause-Wife-Shynel-Krause-300x300.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_Of_James_Krause></span>What Is The Net Worth Of James Krause?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Krause’s net worth is believed to be at $400,000.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_James_Krause%E2%80%99s_Height></span>What Is James Krause’s Height?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Krause is 6 feet and 2 inches tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_James_Krause%E2%80%99s_Weight></span>What Is James Krause’s Weight?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Krause’s current weight is 183 pounds.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=James_Krause%E2%80%99s_Fight_Schedule></span>James Krause’s Fight Schedule<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the age of 19, James Krause found MMA. He had an 18-1 record as an amateur fighter. During that period, he won two championships and was recognised as the country’s top amateur fighter at one point.</p><p>He made his professional debut in 2007 with Kansas’ Titan Fighting Championships.

In the bout, James Krause was knocked out in the first round by Justin Lawrence.</p><p>On June 30, 2012, James Krause returned to the Resurrection Fighting Alliance and defeated another Ultimate Fighter audition veteran, Amir Khillah, via split decision. His next bout in the RFA concluded in 31 seconds by knockout, with James Krause prevailing once more. Following his submission of his next opponent, Joe Jordan, at RFA 5, James Krause would call out UFC matchmaker Joe Silva and request that he “give him a call.”</p><p>At UFC 161, James Krause would make his UFC debut against veteran Sam Stout. After a back-and-forth fight, James Krause would eventually finish Stout with a guillotine in the third round. This victory would also earn him the bonuses for Submission of the Night and Fight of the Night.</p><p>Krause’s next UFC battle, against Bobby Green, would conclude on a contentious note. Green repeatedly kicked Krause below the belt, resulting in a one-point deduction by referee John McCarthy. Green would then strike another kick to the belt line of James Krause, crumpling him. Green would win the TKO after John McCarthy declared it a lawful blow.</p><p>At UFC 173, James Krause will battle Jamie Varner. Varner suffered a broken ankle in the first round and was unable to continue, so the bout ended in a TKO for James Krause.</p><p>At UFC 178, James Krause will meet Jorge Masvidal. Masvidal would be declared the winner by a unanimous vote.</p><p>James Krause would lose another decision, this time a split decision, to Valmir Lazaro at UFC 184.</p><p>James Krause would turn things around at UFC on Fox 16 in July 2015, when he successfully defeated Daron Cruickshank by submission in the first round.</p><p>James would win his next fight at UFC Fight Night 83 against Shane Campbell. He’d be given a unanimous decision.</p><p>The Ultimate Fighter 23 Finale was supposed to feature James Krause vs. Ross Pearson, but he was withdrew from the bout for unclear reasons.

He would defeat Moraes in the third round and earn the Performance of the Night prize.</p><p>At UFC 247 in February 2020, James Krause would face Trevin Giles on short notice at middleweight. By doing so, he also won a new four-fight contract with the UFC. He was defeated by a split decision. The fight received the Fight of the Night bonus. Later, it was determined that Krause and his team would appeal the split judgement owing to a suspected conflict of interest because one of the judges who helped sway the decision in Giles’ favour had a link to Giles’ training squad.</p><p>James Krause defeated Claudio Silva by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night 180 in October of 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Best_Fight_of_All_Time_for_James_Krause></span>Best Fight of All Time for James Krause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With so many incredible fights to choose from, it’s impossible to pick just one as James Krause’s best. It could be argued that his last fight with the Resurrection Fighting Alliance, in which he submitted Joe Jordan, was his best fight, because as a result of that fight and his refusal of UFC matchmaker Joe Silva, he was given another chance with the UFC, where he still is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/James-Krause-1-1-300x300.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_defeated_James_Krause></span>Who defeated James Krause?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Krause, like every long-time MMA competitor, has tasted defeat.</p><p>He has lost in the UFC to Trevin Giles (albeit this fight was controversial), Valmir Lazaro, Jorge Masvidal, and Bobby Green (although this fight too, had notes of controvery).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Record_of_James_Krause></span>Record of James Krause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Krause has a professional record of 28 wins and 8 losses.
