Used sparingly in 2005â€“06, he was loaned out to Oxford United in March 2006, though did not make it onto the pitch. In 2006â€“07 he was loaned out to Darlington and Stafford Rangers, before he spent the 2007â€“08 campaign on loan at Halifax Town. In April 2008 he signed with Port Vale, and became a first team regular in 2008â€“09. He remained a key first team figure in 2009â€“10 and 2010â€“11, and was voted the club's Player of the Year in 2010. He continued to impress for the "Valiants", and earned a move up a division to Leyton Orient in May 2012. He returned to Port Vale on loan in March 2013, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012â€“13, before re-joining on a permanent basis in the summer. He signed with Shrewsbury Town in August 2014, before moving on to Carlisle United in January 2015. Six months later he signed for Altrincham before retiring in September 2015 due to a hip injury. He came out of retirement to sign for Glossop North End in September 2016. In 2017 he played for Trafford, Colwyn Bay, and Congleton Town.</p><span>2006</span><p>Griffith started his senior career at Halifax Town as a sixteen-year-old. Impressing at the non-league side, he was snapped up by Doncaster Rovers in 2005. However, he never made it as a regular first team player at "Donny" and was instead loaned out to four lower league clubs over two years. On 21 March 2006, he joined Oxford United on a month-long loan. However, he never made it onto the pitch for the League Two side.</p><span>2007</span><p>On 23 November 2007 he joined Darlington, again of League Two, on another one-month spell. He made four appearances for the club. He then spent three months with Conference club Stafford Rangers from 26 January 2007, making a total of twenty appearances. Despite only featuring in the first two rounds of the competition, he received a League Trophy winners medal after Doncaster won the 2007 final. He then spent the entire 2007â€“08 season on loan at former club Halifax Town. He made close to forty appearances before returning to Doncaster, where he was subsequently released.</p><span>2008</span><p>Griffith was signed by Port Vale manager Lee Sinnott in April 2008. He spent much of the 2008â€“09 season at right-back under new manager Dean Glover. For the 2009â€“10 season, new manager Micky Adams elected to return Griffith to the role of 'midfield enforcer'. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained in the first team however, and was playing in the form of his life under Adams, striking up a midfield pairing with Tommy Fraser, who he also shared a house with. His committed performances made him "a darling of the terraces", though he also picked up fourteen yellow cards throughout the season. At the end of the season he was offered a two-year contract, and was given the Player of the Year award. He duly signed the contract.</p><span>2010</span><p>On 28 August 2010 Griffith scored from 25-yards at Vale Park past Torquay United's Scott Bevan in a 2â€“1 reverse. The goal would prove to be more important to Griffith himself and the Torquay opposition than to his own club, the fine strike his first in the Football League, and his first in Port Vale colours. It also ended the Gulls' run without conceding a league goal at the 998 minute mark, a club record but not a Football League record. He started the season strongly, forming a solid midfield partnership with Gary Roberts. Despite losing his place to Doug Loft following an injury that kept him sidelined for a month, he returned to post 45 appearances in 2010â€“11.</p><span>2011</span><p>Griffith has a daughter, Mya Rose Griffith, born in early 2011. He is a cousin of Grenadian international striker Delroy Facey, and Delroy's brother Danny. He also has a lot of relatives in <a href=#>Jamaica</a>.</p><span>2012</span><p>In May 2012, out-of-contract Griffith was reported to have been a target for Leyton Orient, Shrewsbury Town, Northampton Town and Bradford City; he was also offered an improved contract at Port Vale. He proved unable to turn down the offer of League One football, and quickly signed a two-year deal with Leyton Orient. Manager Russell Slade signed Griffith as a replacement for departing captain Stephen Dawson, and reportedly doubled his wages to tempt him down south to Brisbane Road.</p><span>2013</span><p>He re-joined Port Vale on a permanent basis in July 2013, signing a one-year contract. He went on to build an impressive partnership in midfield with Chris Lines in the 2013â€“14 season; Griffith providing the tough-tackling and Lines providing the creative playmaking. Despite making 45 appearances across the season he was not offered a new contract in the summer.</p><span>2014</span><p>On 27 August 2014, Griffith signed for League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a one-year contract, citing manager Micky Mellon as a major reason for his decision to join the club. Described as "being popular in the dressing room", he became a fringe players, making only six first team appearances for the "Shrews".</p><span>2015</span><p>In July 2015, Griffith signed a one-year deal with National League side Altrincham in a move that reunited him with his former Vale boss Lee Sinnott. He played two games for the "Robins" before retiring due to a hip injury in September 2015. He returned to football in September 2016 after signing for Northern Premier League Division One North side Glossop North End. He was voted as the club's Player Of The Month for November 2016 by supporters. He signed with divisional rivals Trafford in March 2017, who ended the 2016â€“17 campaign in sixth-place, two points outside the play-offs.</p><span>2017</span><p>Griffith signed with Northern Premier League Division One North club Colwyn Bay as a player-coach in May 2017. Six months later he joined <a href=#>North West</a> Counties League Premier Division side Congleton Town.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1986 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Sportspeople from Huddersfield</a> <a href=#>Black British sportspeople</a> <a href=#>Montserrat international footballers</a> <a href=#>Montserratian footballers</a> <a href=#>English people of Montserratian descent</a> <a href=#>English footballers</a> <a href=#>Montserratian expatriate footballers</a> <a href=#>Association football fullbacks</a> <a href=#>Association football midfielders</a> <a href=#>Doncaster Rovers F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Oxford United F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Darlington F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Stafford Rangers F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Halifax Town A.F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Port Vale F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Leyton Orient F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Harrogate Town F.C. players</a> <a href=#>Shrewsbury Town F.C. players</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeRo8Gpu82yZKCqmZuzqsDHZqWerF2svLPAx2ZtbW5lbg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-griffith-net-worth-64659.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./can-i-be-both-infj-and-intj.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./can-i-be-both-infj-and-intj.html>Can I be both INFJ and INTJ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-jose-condessa-star-of-netflixs-turn-of-the-tide.html>Who is Jos Condessa, star of Netflixs Turn of the Tide?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-jose-condessa-star-of-netflixs-turn-of-the-tide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
