He currently plays for the prestigious La Liga club Real Madrid and represents the Turkey national team.</p><p>Güler began his youth career at Gençlerbirliği, an Ankara-based club, in 2014. In 2019, he joined the youth ranks of Fenerbahçe, one of Turkey’s prominent clubs. On January 13, 2021, Güler signed a two-and-a-half-year professional contract with Fenerbahçe, where he quickly gained recognition as a wonderkid and a promising prospect for the future.</p><p>During the 2021-22 season, Güler made his senior debut as a substitute player in a match against Finnish club HJK in the play-off round of the UEFA Europa League.

His impressive performances caught the attention of several top European clubs, including Arsenal, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>On March 17, 2022, Fenerbahçe announced that they had secured Güler’s services with a three-year contract. In the following 2022-23 season, Güler was given the number 10 jersey, which holds special significance for Fenerbahçe fans as it was previously worn by club legend Alex de Souza.
