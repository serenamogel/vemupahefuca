His father’s name is unknown but is said to have been a police officer, while his mother’s name is Linda Ripa, an author by profession famous for her book “The Ladybug Blues,” published in 2002.</p><p>Sergio is of white ethnicity and is an American by nationality, with his zodiac sign being Virgo.</p><p>There is no available information on his early days as a child, such as where he spent his childhood and if he was the only child of his parents or had siblings whom he grew up alongside.</p><p>Sergio Ripa’s educational background is not available online at the time of writing. While we are not certain if the 24-year-old had any form of education, he has not helped by keeping mum over it. If he indeed had some form of education, the schools he attended are not known. Also, we cannot tell what level of education he must have acquired or the certificate or degrees – if any – he has.</p><h2><strong>He Survived a Ghastly Accident and Subsequent Coma as a 7-month-old</strong></h2><p>Sergio Guiseppe Ripa is a miracle child. While his mother, Linda Ripa, was seven months pregnant with him, she was involved in a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ghastly motor accident</a> and sustained a broken pelvis and numerous other fractures.</p><p>A minivan driven by an intoxicated driver crashed into her vehicle while she was driving, which resulted in Sergio being born prematurely and slipping into a coma. Mother and son battled for their lives for weeks, and the former had to undergo major surgery to save her baby and also a leg surgery.</p><p>For an operation that requires one to take anesthetics, Linda refused to take any in the bid to save her child, and as fate would have it, in the space of four weeks, Sergio regained consciousness which brought about the name his mother fondly calls him “Magical Boy”.</p><h2><strong>Sergio Ripa is Famous For Being the Son of Linda Ripa</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Linda-Ripa-1.jpg><p>Sergio Guiseppe Ripa, by profession, is a guitarist and musician, a career which he took up at a young age, although he rose to prominence as a result of his famous mother, Linda Ripa, and his aunt, Kelly Ripa, who is a well-recognized actress.</p><p>The entertainer is still pushing in his career and is most certainly going to be a force to reckon with in the entertainment industry.</p><p>His mother, Linda Ripa, born December 3, 1968, in Camden County, New Jersey, is a multi-talented woman and has worked in various fields in the process of charting a career path for herself. She has been involved in one way or the other with Expressions Modeling and Talent, New Media productions, Neurolinguistic Programming, Philly 57, and CN8, among others.</p><p>Linda later became an author and is currently recognized for the book titled, The Ladybug Blues, which she wrote while she was on best rest recovering from the accident. There is no information on her relationship with Sergio’s father, such as how they met, how long they dated, and also if they got married. The author is a very private person and has done a good job concealing details of her personal life.</p><h3><strong>He is also the Nephew of Famous Actress, Kelly Ripa</strong></h3><p>The 24-year-old Sergio Guiseppe Ripa is also widely recognized for being the nephew of Kelly Ripa, a well-recognized American actress, and talk show host. Kelly is mostly famed for being the co-host of the morning talk show ‘Live with Kelly and Ryan.’</p><p>Kelly Ripa shares a close bond with her nephew Sergio and has taken to her Instagram account mostly on his birthdays to share his photos which results in her fans flooding her page with lots of comments, with some citing the striking resemblance between Sergio and Kelly Ripa. The actress also shares a close bond with her elder sister, Linda Ripa.</p><p>The actress had her breakthrough in the entertainment industry in 1990 when she was featured in the Soap opera titled All My. She did not only gain recognition from her role in the series but also met her husband, Mark Cousuelos, on the show.</p><h2><strong>Sergio Guiseppe Ripa is Not in Any Known Relationship</strong></h2><p>The singer is a not in any known relationship at the moment, and there has been no information about any past or present relationship. This is either because he is very good at concealing his private life from the public and media, or he is indeed single at the moment as there is no social media post addressing his relationship status at the moment.</p><p>Notwithstanding, Sergio is a fine promising young gentleman who will certainly attract many beautiful women. When the time is right, he will most certainly update us on his relationship status.</p><h2><strong>What is Sergio Ripa’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Sergio Ripa does not have any net worth estimate at the moment as he has not disclosed his earnings to any source, although he earns from his celebrity life and other sources. However, his mother’s net worth is estimated to be approximately $10 million which is from her career as an author, and his aunt Kelly Ripa has a whooping net worth of $120 million.</p><p>With his mother’s net worth of $10 million and his aunt Kelly Ripa’s net worth of $120 million, Sergio Guiseppe Ripa is living a life of comfort and luxury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmarlae0qruMoKCuq5WlvaZ50aKnmmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-sergio-giuseppe-ripa.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rick-devens.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rick-devens.html>Rick Devens</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./married-at-first-sight-are-lauren-and-orion-still-together.html>Married at First Sight: Are Lauren and Orion Still Together?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./married-at-first-sight-are-lauren-and-orion-still-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
