On the morning of January 28, 1986, what was meant to be a seminal moment for NASA and the future of space travel turned into a disaster that was viewed on live TV by millions around the country. Further wall-to-wall coverage and years of retrospectives have seared the grainy image of a faulty rocket bursting into flames and the Challenger and its seven brave passengers veering off course into the national consciousness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Challenger had flown nine times before over the previous nine years and helped the United States reach <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.space.com/18084-space-shuttle-challenger.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="several important milestones" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">several important milestones</a>. The shuttle brought the first woman and African American into space, hosted the first space lab and enabled the first astronaut-run satellite repair. But it was the tenth and ultimately ill-fated launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida that was by far the Challenger’s most anticipated, in large part thanks to the unique nature of the crew that was making the journey.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Any disaster of this magnitude is a great tragedy, but the Challenger’s doomed journey felt especially devastating because it carried a crew that reflected the diversity of the United States and multiculturalism that was beginning to emerge after the civil rights era. Most of the astronauts were making history of some kind, leaving many different communities in mourning.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Christa McAuliffe</h2><img alt="Christa McAuliffe" title="Christa McAuliffe" width=1109 height=1664 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-challenger-christa-mcauliffe-16492799851_nasa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: NASA</span><p>Christa McAuliffe</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Much of the excitement centered on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/astronaut/christa-mcauliffe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christa McAullife" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Christa McAullife</a>, a teacher from New Hampshire who was to become the first civilian to fly in space.

She became an overnight celebrity and the focus of extensive media attention, as did her family and students at Concord High School. McAuliffe trained for six months to join the crew as a payload specialist, and she was to both help with experiments on the space station as well as give two lessons that would be broadcast to classrooms across the country. Schools around the country tuned into the Challenger’s launch due to her presence on the shuttle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The two lessons that McAuliffe had planned, titled “The Ultimate Field Trip" and "Where We've Been, Where We're Going, Why,” were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://apnews.com/2e207c8794a24bf9a3a32c9e39127e40/1st-of-Christa-McAuliffe's-lost-lessons-released-from-space" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later recorded on the International Space Station" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later recorded on the International Space Station</a>.

He was born and raised in Hawaii, and brought the islands’ culture along with him throughout his career in the military and with NASA, becoming an ambassador of sorts who delighted crewmates with large pig roasts during their time together in training.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like many of his fellow Challenger astronauts, Onizuka was a trained engineer who served in the armed forces during the 1970s, serving as a test pilot throughout the decade. In 1978, he was one of 35 hopefuls chosen for NASA’s first new astronaut program since 1969, a group dubbed “The 35 New Guys,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/with-every-first-in-space-new-dreams-are-launched data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="despite the presence of six women" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">despite the presence of six women</a> in the class.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Onizuka flew on one previous space shuttle mission, the third flight of the Discovery in 1985.

His biography usually begins with his insistence, as a 9-year-old child living in a low-income community in segregated South Carolina, to check out a library book despite the refusal of a racist librarian. The police were called, but even at 9 years old, McNair knew his rights, stood up for himself and he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/28/133275198/astronauts-brother-recalls-a-man-who-dreamed-big data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wound up checking out that library book" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wound up checking out that library book</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McNair went on to read a lot more books, earning his Ph.D. in physics from MIT. Just a few years later, he was invited to join that class of ‘78 at NASA. No Black person had ever flown into space at that point — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/02/20/black-in-space-looks-at-final-frontier-of-civil-rights/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="two had been chosen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">two had been chosen</a> for the astronaut training program in the 1960s, but one was not selected to join NASA and the other, who was invited to become an astronaut, died during a test flight. The agency worked to recruit potential Black astronauts when it resumed its program, in part by using Nichelle Nichols, an iconic Star Trek cast member, in its commercials.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A man of many talents, McNair was a six-degree black belt in karate and an accomplished saxophone player. His first flight was aboard the Challenger in 1984, and on that journey, he became the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.blackhistory.mit.edu/archive/ron-mcnair-plays-sax-space-1984 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first person to play music in space" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">first person to play music in space</a>. He had planned to become the first person to play a concert via live feed during the Challenger mission that never made it past the Earth’s atmosphere.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Judith Resnik</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Judith Resnik was just 28 when she was asked to join NASA as a part of the 1978 class.

In between her two degrees, she worked for RCA, helping on high-level projects for major clients (including NASA) and then went on to work for the National Institutes of Health as a biomedical engineer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She was so impressive that she joined NASA just a year after receiving her doctorate and spent the next five years training to be an astronaut and working on other space-related projects. She had a bubbly personality and big head of curly hair that made for fun photo opportunities in zero gravity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Resnik made her first flight into space aboard the Discovery in 1984. In doing so, she became the first Jewish woman and first American Jew to make it off-planet. She was also the second woman ever to make it into space, following in the footsteps of her ‘78 classmate, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/astronaut/sally-ride data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sally Ride" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sally Ride</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Dick Scobee</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The commander of the Challenger on that fateful morning in late January, Lt. Col. Francis Richard Scobee had a remarkable career in both the Air Force and NASA. He served in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vietnam War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vietnam War</a>, flying in combat missions for three years before returning to the United States and becoming a test pilot for cutting edge aircraft through the late 1970s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After that, he was chosen as a candidate to become an astronaut in 1978, in the same class as Onizuka, McNair and Resnik, and aced all of the training and exams. That was no surprise, because not only was he a great pilot and aerospace engineer, Scobee was something of a polymath. His official NASA biography detailed a long list of hobbies, including flying, oil painting, woodworking, motorcycling and racquetball.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Scobee’s first trip to space also came aboard the Challenger, when he served as its pilot during its fifth flight in April 1984. He was known for his prowess in the sky and cool demeanor. After the investigation into the crew’s final minutes concluded that they likely survived until the compartment hit the ocean, a close friend and fellow astronaut named Robert Overmayer said he was certain that Scobee gave everything he had in the fight for survival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew,” Overmayer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3078062#.X17jWZNKgbk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. “Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down.”</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Gregory Jarvis</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The only other crew member who didn’t come through traditional astronaut training, Gregory Jarvis was an engineer who wound up on the Challenger through hard work and a lot of bad luck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jarvis spent his whole career in and around aeronautics, beginning with his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/jarvis.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="joining the Air Force during the Vietnam War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">joining the Air Force during the Vietnam War</a> and working in the space division, with a specialty in satellites. After his discharge, he began to work for Hughes Aircraft, a major military and NASA contractor and eventually worked on space-related crafts. After nearly a decade of working for Hughes, he applied for and beat out 600 other engineers at the company for the opportunity to work on a NASA space shuttle. Technically, he was to be a payload specialist, which is the blanket term for any non-astronaut who goes up into space on a NASA mission.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jarvis was twice bumped from the flight roster by politicians. He was first billed to make his journey into space in April 1985 but was replaced by Senator Jake Garn (R-UT) and then got pushed back in line by Rep. Bill Nelson (D-FL) in early January 1986. Instead, he was put aboard the Challenger’s fateful late January flight.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Michael J. Smith</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like Scobee, who piloted the fifth Challenger mission, Michael J.
