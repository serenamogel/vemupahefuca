Although Santos admitted to lying as part of his campaign to win his congressional spot, he pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><h2><strong>Who Is George Santos?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>George Santos, whose full name is George Anthony Devolder Santos, is a well-known and recognized leader in the United States. He is currently the representative for New York’s 3rd congressional district. It is important to note that he is the first openly LGBT Republican elected to Congress.</p><p>Santos was born on July 22, 1988, to Fátima Aziza Caruso Horta Devolder and Gercino Antônio dos Santos Jr. He went to Intermediate School 125 in Woodside, Queens, and Primary School 122 in Astoria, Queens, for his official schooling.</p><h2><strong>George Santos Career</strong></h2><p>Santos left Brazil while he was being charged with check theft and went to New York City, where he worked as a customer service rep for Dish Network from October 2011 to July 2012.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Santos worked for HotelsPro, which is a part of MetGlobal, a company based in Istanbul, Turkey, that turned out to have a lot of bad reviews on the internet. This was reported by the New York Times sometime around 2013.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>When Santos moved to Orlando, Florida, in early 2016, he changed his driver’s licence to show that he lived there and registered to vote.</p><p>HotelsPro was going to open an office in Orlando. He began working for the alternative finance firm Harbour City Capital in Florida sometime in January 2020, not long after he announced his first run for Congress in November 2019.</p><p>Santos set up a Harbour City Capital office during his first run for Congress. A month after that, he became the company’s regional director for New York. He talked about the $1.5 billion in assets he was in charge of for Harbour City in an interview from 2020.</p><p>The assets had an internal rate of return of 26% and a stable yield income return of 12%. Santos started the Devolder group after Harbour City paid him until at least April 2021. He has said that this group is what makes him rich.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><strong>George Santos Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>On January 10, 2023, Santos was officially charged with 23 counts of theft in two federal charges.</p><p>The new 23-count charge adds two more fraud schemes: the credit card plan and the plot to lie to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) about campaign donations to make them look bigger than they really were. The goal of this dishonest act was to trick the Republican party into giving money.</p><p>Santos is accused of coming up with a plan to illegally get the names and bank account information of people who gave money to his campaign.</p><p>In this plan, he charged their credit cards and put the money from other campaigns and his own into his own personal bank account. Santos is set to appear in federal court on October 27, 2023. It is likely that new charges will be brought against him at this hearing.</p><h2><strong>George Santos Net Worth</strong></h2><p>It is thought that Santos’ net worth will be a little more than $11 million in 2023. This includes all of his property and money from politics.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCzxKipoJ1dqK6vwM6sZKedpGLEsL7ToWShp6diuravx2agrGWYmnq4u9Gtn2ZrXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-santos-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth-3.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./juliette-weg-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-167386-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./juliette-weg-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-167386-html.html>Juliette Weg Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./motorsport-html.html>Migos MotorSport lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./motorsport-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
