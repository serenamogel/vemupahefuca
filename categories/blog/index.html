It is possible for an attribute to have more than one value at the same time when it is a multivalued attribute. Because a surgeon may possess more than one talent, the skills of a surgeon, for example, are a multivalued characteristic. The address field, which may have numerous values such as zipcode, street address, state, and so on is another prominent example of this kind of field.</p><footer><a href=../../what-is-multivalued-attribute-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../ulrich-matthes.html>Ulrich Matthes movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>Recommended Videos In this fan’s opinion, no episode of American Dad! can be truly great if the plot is too heavily skewed to favor only one of the show’s main characters, which is the case in “Steve and Snot’s Test-Tubular Adventure.” The premise leaves Roger and Hayley in diminished roles, with little Francine, and, unsurprisingly, no Klaus at all. Disappointing character representation aside, this episode is ultimately satisfying. The tiring, hackneyed plot device of Steve aiming to lose his virginity after prom opens the story in a frustrating way, but the concept redeems itself pleasantly, starting with a failed-expectations twist and ending with an encouraging moral.</p><footer><a href=../../american-dad-review-steve-and-snots-test-tubular-adventure.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../show.html>Audio Quality: RightMark Audio Analyzer 24/96</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
