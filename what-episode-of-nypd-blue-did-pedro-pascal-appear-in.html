But, what many don’t realize is that before he became the household name he is today, Pascal appeared in an episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYPD Blue</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-what-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pascal-appear-in data-injectable=false>What episode of&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;did Pascal appear in?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>For the uninitiated,&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;was a police procedural drama series that aired between 1993 and 2005. It was a massively praised show, winning over ten Prime Time Emmys and being a regular fixture at all TV award shows. This was because, unlike similar shows at the time,&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;was grittier and more realistic. Plus, the show spent a lot of time focusing on the characters’ problems in their personal lives and how it affected their work.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Pascal appeared in the ninth episode of the show’s eighth season, “Oh Golly Goth.” It should be noted that this episode aired in 2001, and at the time, Pascal was a very new actor, having made his TV debut only a few years before in 1999’s&nbsp;Good vs. Evil.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>“Oh Golly Goth” sees the team having to deal with the aftermath of a stabbing. Three goths are implicated in the crime due to being at the same party, forcing the cops to learn about a subculture they know little to nothing about. Pedro Pascal plays Shane ‘Dio’ Morrissey, one of the goths. Pascal is involved in a highly memorable interrogation scene that shows that even in 2001, the actor had a fantastic range and a talent for bringing unusual personalities to life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-why-are-people-talking-about-pascal-s-nypd-blue-role data-injectable=false>Why are people talking about Pascal’s&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;role?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>This role is being talked about because Pascal mentioned it during his appearance on the hot-wing-based interview show&nbsp;Hot Ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>When asked about some of his unique roles, Pascal mentioned his appearance on&nbsp;NYPD Blue.&nbsp;He said: “There was a really, really unusually fun character that I played on NYPD Blue, this goth guy named Dio. And he had all these fake piercings and was just a teenager hitting on the female cop.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=766 data-current-count=1072 data-injectable=true>However, what has really caught the internet’s attention is Pascal saying that he made up his own language for the role. He said: “At one point, he has a pentagram on the inside of his palm that they made with a black sharpie, and I lick it, and I make up some Satanic language. I thought it was supposed to be like, Latin or something. And I remember thinking, ‘Do you have Latin words I’m supposed to learn?’ and they’re like ‘No dude, just make it up.’ And I was like, ‘oh, okay.’ It was a kind of thing where I licked the hand, and then I turned slowly toward the camera going,” explains Pascal. He then makes a series of disturbing sounds with his mouth, before quickly snapping back to normal.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>He then finishes the earlier statement by adding: “some crazy shit like that on an episode of your ABC Network television hit, ‘NYPD Blue.’ I made up the language.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ6omai8pbGMqJ1mpqmlsW6uy66cZpyZmXqxscOrpmaokaiworiMmqepnZGneqq6jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-episode-of-nypd-blue-did-pedro-pascal-appear-in.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./black-dynamite-2009.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./black-dynamite-2009.html>Black Dynamite movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-cabrera-net-worth-age-relationship-career-family-and-more.html>Ryan Cabrera: Net worth, age, relationship, career, family and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-cabrera-net-worth-age-relationship-career-family-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
