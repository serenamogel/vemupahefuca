Winning on the show was a surreal and unexpected experience for her, as she recalled expressing doubt about her chances right before the Final Jeopardy round. However, to her amazement, she secured a victory by correctly answering the final question, “Nicknamed ‘the kingdom in the sky,’ this landlocked nation is the only country in the world to lie entirely above 4,000 feet,” with “Lesotho.”</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tips_for_Aspiring_Contestants></span><span><strong>Tips for Aspiring Contestants</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Reflecting on her experience, Nyquist offered some practical tips for future Jeopardy! contestants.
