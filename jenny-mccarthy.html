Named the 1994 Playboy Playmate of the Year, the beauty leveraged her fame into hosting roles on MTV's Singled Out and The Jenny McCarthy Show. Following a short-lived stint as co-host of The View, McCarthy shared top billing with husband <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/donnie-wahlberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donnie Wahlberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donnie Wahlberg</a> on the reality series Donnie Loves Jenny, and in 2019 she began her run as a judge on the popular TV competition series The Masked Singer. McCarthy has also written multiple best-selling books dealing with the topic of autism.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and 'Playboy'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jenny McCarthy was born in Illinois on November 1, 1972. McCarthy got her career start in 1993, when she began modeling for Playboy. In 1994, she was named the publication's Playmate of the Year.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">TV and Film: 'Singled Out' to 'The Jenny McCarthy Show'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy continued to gain fame as the co-host of MTV's dating-game show Singled Out, alongside Chris Hardwick, from 1995 to 1997. She left the show to begin hosting her own show on the network, a sketch-comedy program called The Jenny McCarthy Show (1997).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy continued to pose for Playboy—most recently appearing on the cover of the magazine's July/August 2012 issue—as well as in advertisements for companies like Candie's. She also appeared in films like Scary Movie 3 and the popular sitcom Two and a Half Men.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, McCarthy hosted the second season of NBC's Love in the Wild, a reality show in which real-life couples participate in challenges. She also returned to television as the host of The Jenny McCarthy Show, this time airing on VH1.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Co-Host of 'The View'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While her self-titled chat show proved to be a disappointment, McCarthy landed a major daytime television gig in July 2013: It was announced that she would be a new host on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/barbara-walters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbara Walters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbara Walters</a>' popular program The View. McCarthy was brought on board to replace the departing Joy Behar (who later returned) for the show's 17th season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"We are delighted that Jenny will be joining us as a permanent co-host," Walters told USA Today. Walters said that McCarthy "brings us intelligence as well as warmth and humor. She can be serious and outrageous. She has connected with our audience and offers a fresh point of view."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy made her debut on The View that September. However, her tenure on the show proved to be short-lived, as McCarthy was let go after only one season. As she later explained to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/howard-stern data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Howard Stern" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Howard Stern</a>, she felt limited on the show, insisting she was "not allowed to be the best of me here."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additional info about her unhappy tenure on the show came with an excerpt from Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of 'The View' in March 2019, which produced the revelation that McCarthy disliked working with Walters.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Donnie Loves Jenny' and 'The Masked Singer'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her stint on The View, McCarthy returned with the reality TV series Donnie Loves Jenny. The program debuted in January 2015 with her wedding to singer and actor Donnie Wahlberg, and focused on their lives as they juggled the demands of family and show business. During these years, McCarthy also hosted a SiriusXM radio show and enjoyed her longtime gig as a contributor to Dick Clark's New Years Rockin' Eve.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2019, McCarthy began her run as a judge on the singing competition series The Masked Singer. Based on a South Korean series, in which celebrities square off against one another while hiding their identities, the show proved popular with fans and quickly earned renewal for a second season on Fox.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life and Controversy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy has a son, Evan Joseph, with ex-husband John Mallory Asher. The couple divorced in 2005. Not long after he was born, Evan was diagnosed with autism. In 2007, McCarthy publicly announced that her son was autistic, and around the same time, began working as an activist on behalf of autism-related organizations, including Talk About Curing Autism and her own group, Generation Rescue.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Controversy was generated for a time over the belief that McCarthy was completely against children being vaccinated, potentially linking immunization shots to the development of autism. She has refuted these claims and asked for more critical thinking. She wrote an essay published on April 12, 2014 for the Chicago Sun-Times where she spoke about her platform, which involves questioning whether physicians should give multiple vaccinations to infants simultaneously instead of spacing them out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy dated actor and comedian <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jim-carrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Carrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Carrey</a> from 2005 to 2010, and later was involved with professional football player Brian Urlacher before beginning her relationship with Wahlberg. In April 2014, McCarthy announced her engagement to Wahlberg on The View, showing the audience her yellow sapphire engagement ring. The couple married on August 31, 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy is also the cousin of comedian and Academy Award-nominee <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/melissa-mccarthy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melissa McCarthy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Melissa McCarthy</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since the birth of her son, McCarthy has authored multiple books on the subject of autism, including the best-sellers Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism (2007) and Mother Warriors : A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds (2008). Earlier written successes include Belly Laughs: The Naked Truth About Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004).</p><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Jenny McCarthy</li><li>Birth Year: 1972</li><li>Birth date: November 1, 1972</li><li>Birth State: Illinois</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Jenny McCarthy rose from the pages of 'Playboy' to become an actress, television personality and best-selling author.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Comedy</li><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Occupations</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Reality Television Star</li><li>Game Show Host</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Jenny McCarthy Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/jenny-mccarthy</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 16, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwtsSnpbJlnZiwor7TobA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenny-mccarthy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paul-nassif.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paul-nassif.html>Plastic Surgeon, Paul Nassif Is Engaged To His Girlfriend Turned Fiance; Father Of Three Children Wa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./david-deluises-biography-weight-loss-net-worth-height-gay-501055-html.html>David DeLuises Biography: Weight Loss, Net Worth, Height.
