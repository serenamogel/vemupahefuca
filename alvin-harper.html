college career.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=College_career class=mw-headline>College Career</span></h3><p>Alvin accepted a football scholarship from the University of Tennessee.</p><p>As a freshman, he appeared in 12 games as a backup&nbsp;wide receiver, making 15 receptions for 247 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>He had a 45-yard touchdown reception in the second game against&nbsp;<strong>Colorado State University.</strong></p><p>Moreover, as a sophomore, he became the team’s starting wide receiver and appeared in 11 games, posting 37 receptions for 487 yards and 5 touchdowns.</p><p>In his first start in the fifth game against <strong>Washington State University</strong>, he set a school single-game record with 12 receptions.</p><p>Furthermore, as a junior, he appeared in 11 games, tallying 13 receptions for 246 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p><p>Likewise, as a senior, Alvin earned All-<a title="Southeastern Conference" href=#>Southeastern Conference</a> Freshman First Team honors in 1987 and All-Southeastern Conference first-team honors in 1990.</p><p>He was also the MVP of the 1991 Hula Bowl and finished his NCAA football career with 103 receptions for 1,547 yards and 16 touchdowns.</p><p>Similarly, Alvin continued to excel in track and field, capturing the 1989 Southeastern Conference indoor high jump championship with a jump of 7 ft 2½in.</p><p>He also anchored the University of Tennessee 4×100 and 4×400 meters relays.</p><h3><span id=Professional_career class=mw-headline>Professional Career</span></h3><h4><span id=Dallas_Cowboys class=mw-headline>Dallas Cowboys</span></h4><p>Furthermore, Harper was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (12th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft to find a receiving partner for starter Michael Irvin.</p><p>He caught 20 passes for 326 yards and one touchdown as a rookie, helping Dallas finish 11–5, its first winning season since 1985.</p><p>He missed the seventh game against the Cincinnati Bengals because of a neck injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alvin-Haper.jpg><p>Moreover, in 1992, Alvin rushed once for 15 yards and caught 35 passes for 562 yards and four touchdowns.</p><p>He probably had the signature play of his career during the NFC Championship against the <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong>, catching a slant route for 70 yards, setting up the Cowboys on the 10-yard line, and sealing the win.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>AQ Shipley Bio: Early Life, NFL, Personal Life & Net Worth>></a></strong></p><h4>Third/Fourth Season with Dallas Cowboys&nbsp;</h4><p>Similarly, Harper also caught a 45-yard touchdown from quarterback <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a> during the 52–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII.</p><p>He dunked the ball over the goalpost crossbar.</p><p>In 1993, Harper established himself as one of the best deep threats in the NFL with a 21.6 yards per catch average and a total of 36 receptions for 777 yards and five touchdowns.</p><p>Alvin again had a key play in the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers after <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a> was knocked out of the game with a concussion.&nbsp;</p><p>During the game, Dallas backup quarterback Bernie Kosar connected with Harper for a 42-yard touchdown.</p><p>That year, Dallas returned to face the Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII, during which Aikman completed a 16-yard pass to give the Cowboys a first-and-goal at the six early in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Thus, that set up a one-yard run by running back Emmitt Smith and helped seal the Bills’ fate as Dallas won 30–13.</p><p>Nonetheless, Harper’s best year came in 1994, when he led the league with a 24.9 yards-per-reception average, catching 33 passes for 821 yards and eight touchdowns.</p><p>However, Dallas failed to make a third consecutive trip to the&nbsp;<a title="Super Bowl" href=#>Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;with a 38–28 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the&nbsp;NFC Championship Game.</p><h4><span id=Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers class=mw-headline>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</span></h4><p>On March 8, 1995, Harper signed a lucrative free-agent contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers based on his big-play ability and championship experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he had a career-high 46 receptions for 633 yards and 2 touchdowns in his first season in Tampa, he could not live up to his free-agent billing.</p><p>Alvin missed the first 3 games of the season because of a left sprained medial collateral and a sprained left ankle in the first preseason game against the New York Jets.</p><p>Moreover, Harper clinched a 14-6 win in the fourth game against the Washington Redskins&nbsp;with a touchdown reception in the final 6 minutes.</p><p>His best game came against the&nbsp;Cincinnati Bengals&nbsp;with 6 receptions for 117 yards and no touchdowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alvin-Harper-Tampa-Bay.jpg><p>Likewise, in 1996, Alvin appeared in 12 games with 7 starts, registering 19 receptions for 289 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>His top receiving game came in the third game against the Denver Broncos, making 2 receptions for 77 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>Similarly, Harper had 4 receptions for 41 yards and no touchdowns in the fifth game against the Detroit Lions.</p><p>Harper was replaced with Robb Thomas in the second half of the sixth game against the Minnesota Vikings and would lose his job as the starter at wide receiver.</p><p>Thus, Harper started once more in the season finale against the Chicago Bears, in place of an injured Thomas.</p><p>On June 10, 1997, the Buccaneers released Alvin before the start of the season.</p><p>During his two years in Tampa, he was slowed by injuries and played in only 25 games, where he caught 65 passes for 922 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Miles Boykin Bio: Football, Career, NFL, Family & Net worth>></a></strong></p><h4><span id=Washington_Redskins class=mw-headline>Washington Redskins</span></h4><p>Furthermore, on June 11, 1997, the&nbsp;Washington Redskins signed Alvin, gambling that he could flourish again after being reunited with head coach Norv Turner.</p><p>Harper was a reserve player in 12 games, in which he caught only 2 receptions for 65 yards in the fourth game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>On December 1st, 1997, the redskins released Harper after he complained about his playing time, following the Redskins 20-23 loss to the St. Louis Rams.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline>New Orleans Saints/ </span><span id=Dallas_Cowboys_2 class=mw-headline>Dallas Cowboys</span></h4><p>Moreover, on December 2, 1997, Alvin was claimed off waiver by the New Orleans Saints.</p><p>However, Harper remained inactive for the last three games

in the fourth game against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alvin-Harper-1.jpg><p>Harper jersey number 80 was used by Ernie Mills, so he chose to wear number 82.</p><p>He appeared in 2 games as a reserve player and did not register any statistics.</p><p>The Cowboys released him on December 7th, 1998.</p><p>Thus, Alvin finished his eight NFL seasons with 191 receptions for 3,473
