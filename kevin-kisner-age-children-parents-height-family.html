He continued to excel in golf while studying at the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the NCAA Division I Championship team in 2005, playing alongside Chris Kirk, Richard Scott, and Brendon Todd.</p><p>After completing his studies in 2006, Kisner turned professional and started playing on the mini-tours, earning three victories between 2007 and 2009. He played in six Nationwide Tour events in 2009 before competing full-time on the Nationwide Tour in 2010, where he won the Mylan Classic and ranked 11th on the money list, earning him a PGA Tour card for 2011.</p><p>Although Kisner failed to retain his card in 2011, he qualified for the 2012 season by finishing T-11 at a qualifying school. However, he failed to keep his card again, and after missing the opportunity to earn one by just one stroke, he returned to the Web.com Tour in 2013. Kisner’s win at the Chile Classic in March of that year and his 13th place on the 2013 Web.com Tour regular-season money list earned him a 2014 PGA Tour card.</p><p>Kisner achieved some impressive finishes in 2014, including 6th place at the Wells Fargo Championship, 8th place at the Wyndham Championship, and 9th place at the RBC Canadian Open. However, it was during the 2015 PGA Tour season that Kisner made his biggest impact, finishing runner-up in three sudden-death playoffs. Despite these near misses, Kisner remained focused and dedicated to his game.</p><p>On November 22, 2015, Kisner finally earned his first PGA Tour victory by winning the RSM Classic. He won the tournament by a six-stroke margin over Kevin Chappell and showed his dominance throughout the weekend. This win elevated him to the top 20 in the world rankings and put him at the forefront of the early FedEx Cup standings going into 2016.</p><p>Kisner’s success on the PGA Tour continued, winning his second PGA Tour title in May 2017 at the Dean & DeLuca Invitational with a one-stroke victory over three other players. He finished runner-up in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play in 2018, losing to Bubba Watson in the final, and tied for second with a score of six-under-par at the 2018 Open Championship.</p><p>In March 2019, Kisner once again reached the championship round of the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, but this time he emerged victorious with a 3 & 2 win over fellow American Matt Kuchar. Kisner’s most recent victory occurred in August 2021 when he won the Wyndham Championship with a birdie on the second extra hole in a six-man sudden-death playoff.</p><h3 class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><strong>What Is Kevin Kisner’s Age?</strong></h3>Kisner was born on February 15, 1984, in Aiken, South Carolina.

Kevin once contemplated joining his father’s business after a difficult 2009 season when he failed to qualify for the PGA Tour.
