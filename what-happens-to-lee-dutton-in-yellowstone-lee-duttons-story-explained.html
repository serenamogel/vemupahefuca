The series, premiering on network television for the first time, will be greeted by new and already adoring audiences as an opportunity to see the thrilling Dutton story from its not-so-humble beginnings.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Fans who have been mentally checking into the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch since 2019 know that Sheridan begins this story with a bang, a crash, and a heartbreaking turn of events from the very beginning. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Costner</a></strong> steals the show as patriarch <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Dutton</a></strong> from the first seconds, seemingly the only survivor in an intense crash, John tells a horse it deserves more, but all he can give it is peace as he offers a mercy killing to the injured animal, and what he does next proves that there’s something else bubbling under the surface, and there always will be.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>John walks over to another vehicle involved in the accident and sees a letter from Paradise Valley Capital Development on the dashboard. Viewers will want to pay close attention to that company as the season kicks off, but there’s more than just a development name of that company means more as the episode rolls on. John walks over to the edge of his land, speaking to the cattle and also himself — he realizes that there’s a lot that must be done to keep the cattle fed and to keep the show running.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Part of what keeps the show running is the Dutton family, and every one of its members (be it blood relation or tied together by the brand) means something special to the equation. So when Sheridan’s storytelling leads to a vital member of the family meeting an early demise, it proves two things immediately: one, Yellowstone is a series that intends to pull no punches, and the deaths that occur, well — they all mean something.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-lee-dutton data-injectable=false>What happened to Lee Dutton?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Lee Dutton was the eldest son of John and Evelyn Dutton, a cowboy through and through and a member of the family who truly knew what it meant to dedicate yourself to the land. Lee didn’t long for a life outside the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch; he appreciated his life at it. Loyal to his father and proud of the Dutton name, Lee was a dream come true for John Dutton.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Fans are given plenty of chances to not just adore Lee in the beginning episode but to also discover that he was the glue that kept John together; he was the son that made it easy for the land owner and patriarch to move forward, as he knew he’d have Lee just a few paces behind him.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Lee’s death was surprising, shocking, and downright heartbreaking — and the reasons are multifaceted. You see, when cattle roamed off of Yellowstone and onto neighboring land, a dispute began with the Indigenous Peoples that inhabited it. While John was urged to leave well enough alone, he didn’t — and his team went in the night’s disguise, but the people of the Broken Rock Indian Reservation knew what was coming their way.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>The Broken Rock Reservation police began attempting to hold off the Livestock agents, and while they were butting heads, Robert Long shot Lee Dutton. Lee fell off of his horse but was still clinging to life when none other than his brother Kayce Dutton arrived to try to de-escalate the situation. Lee felt himself slipping, and Robert wasn’t backing down; as he pulled his gun again, ready to fire, Kayce did too.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happened to Robert Long?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeremiah Bitsui (@jeremiahbitsui)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Robert Long may have pulled the trigger, firing the bullet that killed Lee Dutton, but he didn’t survive long enough to face repercussions or recognize the weight of his decision. Kayce saw Robert getting ready to fire again, and he beat him to the punch, shooting him five times and taking his life in the process.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Kayce attempted to get Lee to safety, but it was too late; the shot he took would be life-ending, and the sad ride to get him to the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is only truly realized when we see the look on John’s face as he realizes he’s just lost his eldest son.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>So why is the story arc of Robert Long so important? For starters, he is the man responsible for taking Lee’s life, but he’s also the brother of Monica Long, aka Monica Dutton, Kayce’s wife. Complicating things on a whole new level, Kayce took the life of his brother-in-law, devastating the family of his wife and further making the bond between himself and his father something hard to navigate. Not to get ahead of ourselves; however, we’ll leave that for another episode.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>There you have it: cowboys and ranch hands — the deaths that kicked off a series unafraid to “go there” and will continue to for each new episode that airs. We’re in the beautiful opening arc of a series that changed television, for some; it’s an exciting rewatch, and for others, it’s the journey of a lifetime from the very start.</p><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Here’s to Yellowstone!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7%2BMraZmpJWaeqXB062mp2WZo3q6sculprCrpKS7pnnLnpxmnKWpwbC60maqraeirnqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-lee-dutton-in-yellowstone-lee-duttons-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chaparro-chuacheneger.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chaparro-chuacheneger.html>Chaparro Chuacheneger: Instagram Star, Internet personality, Age, Height, Meme, Singing, Net Worth,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./arm-announces-neoverse-v1-n2-platforms-cpus-cmn700-mesh.html>The SVE Factor - More Than Just Vector Size</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./arm-announces-neoverse-v1-n2-platforms-cpus-cmn700-mesh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
