The Jerry Rice Award winner is expected to be a top pick in the NFL Draft in 2021.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Trey_Lance_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Trey Lance? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Trey is still in his sophomore year of college and has just started his football career with the San Francisco 49ers. He hasn’t played many professional matches, so his earnings are now modest. He was unable to earn much over the years because collegiate players are not compensated.<strong> His net worth is expected to reach around $500,000 in 2022,</strong> with the majority of his assets and fortune coming from his family.</p><h2><span id=Trey_Lance-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Parents>Trey Lance- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Parents</span></h2><p>Trey Lance was born to Carlton and Angie Lance on May 12th, 2000 in Marshall, Minnesota, United States. His father is black, and his mother is White Caucasian, hence he is of mixed ancestry. His father was also a football player at Southwest Minnesota State, where he played cornerback. He also played in the Canadian Football League for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the World League of American Football for the London Monarchs. Throughout his high school and college years, Trey was primarily trained by his father. Bryce Lance, his younger brother, is also a member of “Bison” and enrolled at NDSU in 2021. He is currently 20 years old and is a Christian.</p><p>Trey finished his middle school schooling at a nearby school and began playing football at the position of quarterback. Later, he attended and graduated from Marshall High School, where he was named Minnesota’s top quarterback. He intended to go to the University of Minnesota to further his education, but he didn’t since he wasn’t recognized as a quarterback prospect, and the team wanted him to play defensive back instead. In 2018, he enrolled in the Strategic Communication department at North Dakota State University, where he also played quarterback football. He is currently in his second year of college.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Trey Lance</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>May 12, 2000</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Marshall, Minnesota, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 4” –&nbsp;</strong>in Centimetres&nbsp;<strong>– 193 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 103 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 226 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chest Size</td><td>42 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Waist Size</td><td>30 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Biceps Size</td><td>15 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>11 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Trey_Lance_8211_Relationship_Married_Life_Girlfriend>Trey Lance – Relationship, Married Life, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Trey has kept his personal life, relationships, and friends private.
