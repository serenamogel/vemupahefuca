Yet, that is the reality of today, as Punk beat Adam Page to win the AEW World Championship at Double or Nothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>many might question the timing of it, there is no question about the fact that he is the top babyface</a> in the company. Yet, is that the best role for Punk as a world champion? Or should he be turning towards the dark side soon and breathing fresh life into his character?</p><h2 id=a-lot-of-fans-have-not-been-impressed-with-babyface-cm-punk>A Lot Of Fans Have Not Been Impressed With Babyface CM Punk</h2><p>CM Punk made his triumphant return to professional wrestling after more than seven years, on the second episode of Rampage in August 2021. While he had not been out of the public eye during that period of time, fighting in the UFC, doing movies and tv shows, and <a href=#>even appearing on WWE Backstage</a>, most fans had given up hope of ever seeing him in a wrestling ring again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CM-Punk-AEW-Debut.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Punk's hometown Chicago crowd blew the roof off of the building and since that very moment, he was the top babyface in AEW. It was truly one of the greatest segments in wrestling history and many would consider it the peak of AEW as well. They have not managed to recapture the magic of that night till now.</p><p>There was more buzz and mainstream attention on the company on that night than there had ever been before or has been since. Punk has remained a babyface as well but his run as the 'good guy' has not impressed a lot of fans.</p><p>The term 'PG Punk' has become popular and while some of his work has been excellent, such as the feud with MJF, it also does feel like we are yet to see the best of the Second City Saint in AEW. Could it take a heel turn for that to happen?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="10 Matches You Forgot CM Punk Competed In">10 Matches You Forgot CM Punk Competed In</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=being-a-heel-suits-the-character-of-cm-punk-better>Being A Heel Suits The Character Of CM Punk Better</h2><p>While Punk might have had notable success in wrestling as a babyface, his best work has always been done as a heel. Whether that be his time on the independent circuits or in the WWE.</p><p>Also, there are various aspects of Punk in AEW, which should see him being the bad guy. He is the ex-WWE talent, who has come on a big contract, taken a top spot on the card, and won the AEW World Championship at the age of 43. Just for comparison, <a href=#>The Rock was 40 when he beat Punk for the WWE Championship</a> at the Royal Rumble in 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="10 Pictures Of CM Punk Like You've Never Seen Him Before ">10 Pictures Of CM Punk Like You've Never Seen Him Before</a></span></p><h2 id=how-cm-punk-should-turn-heel-in-aew>How CM Punk Should Turn Heel In AEW</h2><p>As the AEW World Champion, there is the perfect opportunity for Punk to turn heel. He just has to make use of unfair means to hold on to his belt against a beloved babyface. Incredibly, MJF might be someone suited for that role after his incredible promo on Dynamite might have turned him into the biggest babyface in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CM-Punk-And-MJF.jpg><p>The logic behind Punk turning heel is clearly there and has been there since the very beginning. Punk can tell the story of how he returned to wrestling because Tony Khan was willing to pay him an incredible amount of money. If it was for the love of wrestling, he would have gone to a company like ROH or NJPW years ago.</p><p>With the mic skills that Punk has, he could truly turn the AEW fans against him and become the biggest heel that the company has ever had.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-turning-heel-would-be-best-for-aew>CM Punk Turning Heel Would Be Best For AEW</h2><p>One has to admit that over the last few years, the buzz around AEW had died down quite a bit. Some of it might be back now though as it looks like the company might be onto something special with the angle involving MJF and the company, which has done a brilliant job of blurring the lines between reality and kayfabe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turning Punk heel would be another shot in the arm of the company and could possibly turn them as hot as they were in the second half of last year, when Punk himself, Bryan Danielson, and Adam Cole had debuted within the space of a month.</p><p>A heel Punk is something that we have not seen for almost a decade now and never in AEW, and it would open up a lot of new possibilities moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRus9GemK1lk6J6scHNpGShnZWherXB0adm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faew-great-cm-punk-heel-turn.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elizabeth-smart-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elizabeth-smart-today.html>Where Is Elizabeth Smart Today?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emily-claxton-obituary-oak-grove-mo-emily-claxton-has-passed-away.html>Emily Claxton Obituary Oak Grove, MO, Emily Claxton Has Passed Away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emily-claxton-obituary-oak-grove-mo-emily-claxton-has-passed-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
